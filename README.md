# ToggleTabTip
Toggles the Tablet Input Panel show/hide on the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and later.  
The code came from this Stack Overflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38774139/show-touch-keyboard-tabtip-exe-in-windows-10-anniversary-edition

To use it, download the .EXE from the Releases section and bind it to a hotkey using a program like AutoHotkey. An sample .AHK script is included. If it doesn't work the first time, try opening the Tablet Input Panel manually first.
